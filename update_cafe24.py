# update_cafe24.py
# This script uses Selenium to simulate logging into Cafe24 admin,
# navigating to a product, and updating its information.

# Before running this script, you ABSOLUTELY NEED TO:
# 1. Install Selenium:
#    pip install selenium
#
# 2. Install ChromeDriver:
#    - Download ChromeDriver matching your Chrome version from: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
#    - Ensure ChromeDriver is in your system PATH or provide its path in CHROME_DRIVER_PATH.
#
# 3. CAREFULLY Customize ALL Placeholder Variables:
#    - CAFE24_ADMIN_URL: The EXACT URL for your Cafe24 admin login page.
#    - ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD: Your Cafe24 admin credentials.
#    - ALL LOCATOR_* variables: These are CRITICAL. You MUST use your browser's
#      developer tools (right-click -> Inspect) to find the correct and robust
#      locators (By.ID, By.NAME, By.XPATH, By.CSS_SELECTOR) for EACH element
#      on YOUR Cafe24 admin interface. The examples provided are generic and WILL NOT WORK.

ADMIN_USERNAME = "YOUR_CAFE24_ADMIN_USERNAME"
ADMIN_PASSWORD = "YOUR_CAFE24_ADMIN_PASSWORD"

# --- Locators for Login ---
# These depend heavily on Cafe24's current login page structure. Inspect carefully!
# Common strategy: Cafe24 often uses iframes for login. You might need to switch to an iframe first.

LOCATOR_PASSWORD_FIELD = (By.ID, "userpasswd") # Example, might be 'userpasswd', 'admin_password'
LOCATOR_LOGIN_BUTTON = (By.XPATH, "//button[@type='submit']") # Example, could be an <a> tag or input

# --- Locators for Product Navigation ---
# These are highly specific. Find the sequence of clicks to get to your product list.

# LOCATOR_ANOTHER_SUB_MENU = (By.ID, "actual_submenu_id_for_product_list") # Alternative

# --- Locators for Selecting a Product ---
# This could be by product name, code, or clicking an edit button in a list.
# For a placeholder, we'll assume you're clicking an "edit" button for a known product.
# To make it dynamic, you'd search for text or a product ID.

LOCATOR_PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION_FIELD = (By.NAME, "product_description_field_name") # e.g., a textarea
