# navigate_files.py
# This script uses pyautogui to simulate user interactions for file navigation in a media player.

# Before running this script, you need to:
# 1. Install pyautogui:
#    Open your terminal or command prompt and run: pip install pyautogui
#
# 2. Identify screen coordinates (if using absolute positioning for clicks):
#    pyautogui.displayMousePosition() can be helpful. Run this in a Python console
#    and move your mouse to the target location to get its coordinates.
#    Alternatively, use image-based searching if your media player's UI elements
#    have consistent appearances (e.g., pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen('file_menu.png')).
#
# 3. Adjust simulated actions based on your media player:
#    - The coordinates for clicks (e.g., 'File' menu) will likely be different.
#    - The number of 'down' key presses might need adjustment.
#    - The key for selection might be different (e.g., 'space' instead of 'enter').
#    - Some media players might respond better to `pyautogui.press()` vs `pyautogui.keyDown()`
#      followed by `pyautogui.keyUp()`.
